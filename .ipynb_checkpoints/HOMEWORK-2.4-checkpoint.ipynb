    "1. These questions will _mostly_ focus on tabular data and Pandas, which will likely include new material, as well as some review and deepening of CS-11x.\n",
    "2. Don't forget to add your name above. You can edit the markdown by double-clicking on the cell. \n",
    "3. Save your work often and commit your changes using git/Github Desktop.\n",
    "4. When you are finished, save your work, convert the Jupytext Notebook to .html format, and submit the HTML file on Canvas.\n",
    "5. When you have completed homework 2.1 - 2.4, push your updated repo to Github.com.\n",

    "- You are not permitted to get the answers from a classmate or to use Github Copilot, chatGPT, etc. on this homework. These exercises are for practice so, if you use outside help in a way that's not permitted, you are only cheating yourself out of a chance to learn and prepare for future quizzes and tests. \n",
    "- Working with an ARC tutor and visiting our TA's office hours are both permitted, but they should be provide advice and support, and you should not expect them to do your work for you. "
